20200424,Premier Su praises Taiwan Model for combating COVID-19,Politics,"Premier Su Tseng-chang praised the Taiwan Model&rsquo;s effectiveness in managing the spread of COVID-19 during a Cabinet meeting April 23 at the Executive Yuan in Taipei City, crediting its success to the vigilance of the country&rsquo;s citizens and intragovernmental cooperation.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵The remarks came after a briefing by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on current coronavirus developments around the world and the Central Epidemic Command Center&rsquo;s latest response measures.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Since coronavirus was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, it has spread to over 180 countries, with 2.7 million confirmed cases and nearly 190,000 deaths, Su said. Taiwan is one of the few places in the world where life goes on as usual, and the country is widely regarded as an exemplary model for addressing the pandemic without massive economic disruption, he added.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Among the new measures announced by the CECC are extensions of restrictions on direct flights between China and Taiwan and airline passenger transits through Taiwan. The new end date of the bans, which were originally to be lifted April 29 and 30 respectively, will be determined as the pandemic situation develops, the CECC said.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵The decision is aimed at safeguarding the health of the country&rsquo;s residents as the outbreak continues to disrupt daily life in Europe and the U.S., and the number of cases in Latin America and Southeast Asia has begun to climb sharply.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Latest statistics from the CECC reveal 428 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan as of April 24, including 30 cases from the ROC Navy combat support vessel Panshi, with six deaths. A total of 2,732,280 cases have been identified in 183 other countries and territories. (TYT-E)<br />

20200421,President Tsai shares Taiwan’s experience managing COVID-19 with Time,Politics,"President Tsai Ing-wen penned an article titled &ldquo;How My Country Prevented a Major Outbreak of COVID-19,&rdquo; published April 16 as part of U.S.-based Time magazine&rsquo;s special series &ldquo;Finding Hope: The Time 100 Community on Navigating our New Reality.&rdquo;<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵The president attributed Taiwan&rsquo;s ability to contain the spread of the disease to community-wide efforts, the necessity of which the country learned through the hard lessons of 2003&rsquo;s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. This past experience spurred officials, health experts from the public and private sectors, and the general populace to rapidly respond to early warning signs in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the coronavirus was first reported last year, Tsai said.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵According to Tsai, the government immediately mobilized upon realizing the potential danger, implementing rigorous screening of passengers arriving from Wuhan in late December followed by the activation of the Central Epidemic Command Center, which put in place travel restrictions and quarantine measures for high-risk inbound passengers. Further measures, including tracking the contacts of confirmed cases, merging individuals&rsquo; travel histories with their medical records stored in the National Health Insurance database and providing transparent information to the public, were instrumental in preventing a widespread outbreak.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Local businesses and apartment communities also deserve credit for doing their part by implementing temperature checks and sterilization procedures to supplement government efforts, Tsai said.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵To ensure an affordable and sustainable supply of surgical masks, the government teamed up with private enterprises to ramp up production while instituting a rationing system for all residents, according to the president. Dubbing this partnership &ldquo;Team Taiwan,&rdquo; Tsai said the efforts additionally enabled the country to donate supplies to allies and like-minded partners in need.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Emphasizing how important unity is in times of global crisis, Tsai also urged the World Health Organization to rethink Taiwan&rsquo;s unfair exclusion from the global body&rsquo;s activities, mechanisms and meetings.

20200417,"Special: Minister Chen talks Taiwan’s WHO exclusion, National Health Insurance",Politics,"<em>Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung discusses how Taiwan Can Help achieve the World Health Organization&rsquo;s vision of Health For All</em><em>.</em><br />
↵<br />
↵<strong>Taiwan Today (TT): </strong>Taiwan&rsquo;s National Health Insurance (NHI) system has been operating since March 1995. What makes the program stand out as a successful example of universal health coverage?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen Shih-chung: </strong>NHI coverage spans both Western and traditional Chinese medicine as well as dental, childbirth and rehab care. These are all available under the NHI with premiums scaling according to how much someone earns, which ensures fairness.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵The system is continuously expanding to cover new medications and treatments based on evaluations of effectiveness and affordability. For example, a new drug for treating hepatitis C was introduced in January 2017, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used in cancer immunotherapy since April 2019.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵This is all possible while covering more than 99 percent of people living in Taiwan. In a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) last year, 89.7 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with the NHI, the highest approval rate in the system&rsquo;s history. According to the Health Care Index compiled by [online business magazine] CEOWORLD, Taiwan&rsquo;s health care system ranked first among 89 countries and territories.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT:</strong> The efficiency of the system owes much to projects promoting digital health. Can you cite some examples?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen:</strong> I must praise the NHI MediCloud System, via which patients&rsquo; medical records can be shared among staffers at different hospitals and clinics. This helps prevent physicians prescribing the same medications or ordering the same tests for a patient, reducing medical resource wastage.&nbsp;<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵For patients, the My Health Bank tool provides easy access to medical records to assist with health management. People can access medical history from the past three years using mobile devices.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT: </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated 2020 as the Year of the Nurse and Midwife. Can you tell us more about the roles these professions play in Taiwan&rsquo;s health care system?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen: </strong>These two professions absolutely lie at the heart of health care in Taiwan, as they do in systems around the world. They play key roles in fulfilling the WHO&rsquo;s Health For All mission. Approximately 174,000 nurses and 179 midwives are currently practicing in Taiwan. To level-up skills in these sectors, the MOHW has held tests for licensed nurses since 2006 and provided extra training. Last year the annual exam for nurses was made biannual to encourage more nurses to advance their careers.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵The MOHW has also invested heavily in nursing in the community with the establishment of home care nursing centers, from which nurses can visit patients in their own homes. By providing guidance and training sessions to interested individuals and organizations, the ministry is expecting 1,000 of these centers to open by 2025.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Global networking is also important for the sectors&rsquo; development. An international seminar is scheduled to take place in Taipei City in September bringing together nursing professionals from home and abroad. Co-organized by Taiwan Nurses Association and International Council of Nurses [the largest organization of its kind worldwide], the event is expected to attract about 200 attendees.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT: </strong>Taiwan is gaining worldwide recognition for its efforts combating coronavirus, performing well to date compared with other developed nations during the COVID-19 pandemic. What has been the secret to this success?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen:</strong> We gained valuable insights from Taiwan&#39;s experience controlling the devastating SARS outbreak in 2003, which helped shape our current response to COVID-19.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Shortly after the SARS outbreak, Taiwan promulgated the regulations governing the Central Epidemic Command Center in 2004 to give the government power to establish a dedicated workforce to address major public health emergencies. Improvements have since been made in various aspects such as implementing an optimized surveillance system, strengthened border controls and quarantine rules, and enhanced contagious diseases screening.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Thanks to the lessons learned and changes made, Taiwan is always vigilant and can respond to an outbreak promptly. As a result, despite being widely predicted to be one of the countries hardest hit by the virus due to our geographical proximity to China, Taiwan has so far reported fewer cases than Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and many European countries. So, I think Taiwan deserves the recognition we have received from the international community.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT: </strong>What measures has Taiwan taken specifically since the world first learned of COVID-19?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen:</strong> As soon as 27 cases of pneumonia with unknown cause were first reported in Wuhan, China on Dec. 31, 2019, Taiwan decided to conduct onboard quarantine on all flights from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. This was the first key step in successfully containing the disease&rsquo;s spread in Taiwan. We have since taken measures to minimize the risk of imported cases, such as closely tracking and tracing people traveling from high-risk areas, and constantly reviewing and updating our immigration policies as the situation evolves.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Slowing community spread is another one of our key strategies. Our public health and civil authorities work with the police in a coordinated effort to manage people under home isolation or quarantine. Such interagency collaboration ensures the effectiveness of these measures and lessens the burden on public health agencies. In addition, we passed the Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens [on Feb. 25] which stipulates that those who fail to meet the obligation of mandatory quarantine will be fined, while those who fully comply with the requirements will be entitled to monetary compensation.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT:</strong> How is technology being utilized in the fight against the disease?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen: </strong>We track the cellphone locations of quarantined individuals to ensure they remain at home. We have also combined the databases of the National Health Insurance Administration, National Immigration Agency and Taiwan Centers for Disease Control to leverage big data analysis. For example, when accessing a patient&rsquo;s record with his or her NHI card, health care providers will be alerted if the patient has recently visited a high-risk area or had close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. In the absence of his or her NHI card, the patient&#39;s ID number may alternatively be used to access travel and contact histories. This ensures health care providers have full disclosure of relevant exposure information.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵In addition, to prevent panic buying and ensure public access to surgical masks, ICT professionals spent two days modifying and testing the NHI&rsquo;s databases to create a name-based mask distribution system. The program was introduced on Feb. 6 and allows the public to purchase masks at a standard price with a weekly quota using an NHI card by visiting public health centers, NHI-contracted pharmacies and drugstores. This initiative has proven effective at a time when there is a global shortage of personal protective equipment.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT: </strong>As cases continue to rise globally, is Taiwan working on medical breakthroughs that could help ease the situation?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen:</strong> The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) launched various projects for combating coronavirus shortly after its discovery at the end of last year. As the only organization in Taiwan qualified to produce blood serum from horses injected with the virus, NHRI is now preparing an equine serum for testing on patients with COVID-19 who are in a critical condition at its National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology (NIIDV).<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Regarding inoculation, NIIDV is focusing on peptide vaccines but is also developing other types. If everything goes as planned, human clinical trials can start shortly. It is also developing a rapid test using SARS antibodies capable of detecting the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵NHRI&rsquo;s Institute of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research has also conducted trials synthesizing up to one gram of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral with potential to treat COVID-19. This paves the way for mass production in case of a major outbreak. In addition, the institute is using artificial intelligence to select medicines most likely to successfully treat COVID-19, with a focus on drugs that can inhibit SARS and are already on the market.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>TT:</strong> Does this pandemic highlight the importance of Taiwan participating in the World Health Assembly (WHA)? What contributions can Taiwan make?<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵<strong>Chen:</strong> The global pandemic response is incomplete without Taiwan. As we&#39;re situated strategically between East and Southeast Asia, our absence in coordinated international health efforts can lead to disastrous consequences.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵We know from our SARS experience that global cooperation is indispensable in the fight against a contagious disease. Therefore, as a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan has committed to observing the International Health Regulations since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, duly investigating and reporting confirmed cases to the WHO. We have also kept China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and the EU up to date on the situation in Taiwan, as well as uploading information on viral sequences to the database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data.<br />
↵&nbsp;<br />
↵Admitting Taiwan to the WHA will allow our officials to engage in discussions with public health leaders from around the world and secure access to timely information. It will also be an occasion where Taiwan can share our experiences in areas such as testing, diagnosis, border control and community outbreak prevention. To avoid a repeat of the current pandemic and effectively ensure global health security, the world must take action to improve communication and transparency.<br />

Among the country’s main export sectors, orders for electronics surged 23.8 percent to US$12.45 billion thanks to robust demand for semiconductor manufacturing and testing services.   Orders for information and communication technology products also fared well, up 6.9 percent to US$11.54 billion. The MOEA attributed the strong showing to the effect of Chinese manufacturing firms resuming production and a boom in telecommuting during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Demand for Taiwan’s other major export items dipped, however, as economies around the world struggle to reopen, with orders for basic metals, machinery, optoelectronic products and petrochemicals as well as plastic and rubber products declining between 1.1 and 19.8 percent during the period.   Taiwan’s top source of orders remained the U.S. at US$11.75 billion, up 9.1 percent year on year.

According to state-owned CPC Corp. headquartered in Kaohsiung, the 64,000 tons of LNG are part of a deal with Singapore-based Shell Eastern Trading Pte Ltd.   The cargo’s arrival coincides with the 30th anniversary of LNG imports to Taiwan, signifying a commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable business practices, CPC said.   By contributing to the long-term national greenhouse gas discharge reduction goal—slashing emissions to no more than 50 percent of the 2005 level by 2050—the shipment will also help transform Taiwan into a low carbon emission homeland, it added.   Extraction of the LNG and delivery to end users are expected to generate 240,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, CPC said, adding these will be offset using nature-based, independently verified credits purchased from various international ecosystem restoration initiatives supported by the U.N. REDD Programme.   These include the Cordillera Azul National Park Project in Peru, Form Reforestation Project in Ghana, and Katingan Peatland and Restoration and Conservation Project in Indonesia.   According to Shell, the company is happy to partner with CPC. Using nature-based offsets in conjunction with LNG will help CPC lower greenhouse gas emissions and support the needs of customers looking to decarbonize their energy use, it said.

20200122,Taiwan export orders up year on year for December 2019,Economics,"Taiwan’s export orders increased 0.9 percent year on year for December 2019 to US$43.78 billion, the first monthly rise in four quarters, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs Jan. 20.   Orders for the main exports sectors of machinery, electronics, and information and communication technology rose 5.1 percent to US$1.77 billion, 4.7 percent to US$12.18 billion and 0.4 percent to US$13.89 billion, respectively.   The strong machinery numbers were attributed by the MOEA to more inbound investment, greater demand from Hong Kong, and an easing of the trade war between the U.S. and China.   A similarly impressive result for electronics was credited by the MOEA to surging demand for 5G telecommunications devices, high-performance computing equipment, and internet of things products and smartphones. This trend carried over to ICT on the back of heightened activity in assembly of computer graphics cards and mobile phones.   Taiwan’s top source of orders remained the U.S. at US$12.71 billion, followed by China and Hong Kong, up 5.6 percent to US$10.39 billion; Europe, up 15.8 percent to US$10 billion; and Association of Southeast Asian Nations, up 4 percent to US$3.66 billion.

On a scale of 0-100, with zero the best possible result, Taiwan scored 23.76, down 1.22 points from the previous edition. This placed it among the 26 percent considered to have “good” or “fairly good” media environments in the annual survey of 180 countries and territories. Taiwan finished second in Asia behind South Korea, 42nd, but ahead of Japan, 66th; Hong Kong, 80th; Malaysia, 101st; Singapore, 158th; and China, 177th. The top three spots worldwide went to Norway, Finland and Denmark, in that order. Cedric Alviani, director of RSF’s East Asia Bureau, said Taiwan is an example of how press freedom can thrive in the region. There is room for improvement, however, with concerns regarding profit-led outlets that encourage polarization and sensationalism in news coverage, he added. According to RSF, the coming decade is pivotal for press freedom, as the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the many crises threatening access to diverse and reliable information. Published annually since 2002, the index assesses countries and territories based on environment and self-censorship, infrastructure quality, legal framework, media independence, pluralism and transparency. Taiwan, first included in the survey in 2013 with a ranking of 47th, fell to 50th and 51st in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

Despite significant improvements in LGBTQ rights across the world, Wang said progress in Asia has been mixed, with the 2019 legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan a landmark development in this regard. By introducing queer storytellers from Asia to a global audience, the festival offers an opportunity to reflect on the obstacles that millions still face today while celebrating the diverse cultures, heritages and identities of communities too often excluded from mainstream discourse, Wang added. Originally set to take place in London from April 18 to May 2 and featuring 29 films from 15 countries, the festival has been rescheduled to later this year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organizer said.

Although the fundraising campaign was intended to run through April 15, the priest said his church is no longer accepting donations having reached its target. According to Rev. Didone, the church will use part of the funds to purchase medical supplies for shipment to Italy, with a fixed amount forwarded to either the Holy See or the church’s headquarters in Italy to help those affected by the pandemic. The reverend, who was granted ROC (Taiwan) citizenship in late 2017, said he is truly grateful to have been dispatched to the country 55 years ago.

Stemming from a collaboration between New Taipei City’s National Human Rights Museum and Taipei-based Spring Hill Publishing, the anthology comprises stories written by 30 local authors from 1948 to 2017. Those featured in the collection include Huang Chun-ming, a prominent figure during Taiwan’s nativist literature movement in the 1970s; Walis Nokan, a prolific award-winning indigenous writer of Atayal heritage; and the late Wu Chou-liu, an influential Hakka journalist and novelist. According to the publisher, transitional justice can be a painful process characterized by confrontation among ethnicities or political parties as different groups interpret history from their own perspectives. The new collection seeks to heal these divides by building a better understanding of this unsettling period in Taiwan’s past and the profound legacy it has left on local society, the publisher said. The White Terror refers to suppression and prosecution of political dissidents during the country’s time under martial law from May 1948 to July 1987 in Taiwan and November 1992 in outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands. The government has since offered official apologies and taken measures to address past injustices. These include issuing reputation rehabilitation certificates clearing victims of charges, offering compensation to victims or surviving family members and passing legislation to bring the country’s related laws in line with the U.N.
